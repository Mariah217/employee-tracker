## Installation

To get started with this command line application, there are several libraries you will need to install: console.table, dotenv, inquirer, mysql and mysql2. To install these, simply go to your terminal and type in npm i (*insert library name here*) and hit enter. Once everything is installed, you will open a new terminal and type in node index.js and it will display the main menu for you to select from.
